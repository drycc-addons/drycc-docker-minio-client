# Drycc Object Storage Client based on MinIO&reg;

## What is Drycc Object Storage Client based on MinIO&reg;?

> MinIO&reg; Client is a Golang CLI tool that offers alternatives for ls, cp, mkdir, diff, and rsync commands for filesystems and object storage systems.

[Overview of Drycc Object Storage Client based on MinIO&reg;](https://min.io/)

This project has been forked from [bitnami-docker-minio-client](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-minio-client),  We mainly modified the dockerfile in order to build the images of amd64 and arm64 architectures.

## TL;DR

```console
$ docker run --name minio-client quay.io/drycc-addons/minio-client:latest
```

### Docker Compose

```console
$ curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drycc-addons/drycc-docker-minio-client/main/docker-compose.yml > docker-compose.yml
$ docker-compose up -d
```
## Get this image

The recommended way to get the Drycc MinIO(R) Client Docker Image is to pull the prebuilt image from the [Container Image Registry](https://quay.io/repository/drycc-addons/minio-client).

```console
$ docker pull quay.io/drycc-addons/minio-client:latest
```

To use a specific version, you can pull a versioned tag. You can view the [list of available versions](https://quay.io/repository/drycc-addons/minio-client?tab=tags) in the Container Image Registry.

```console
$ docker pull quay.io/drycc-addons/minio-client:[TAG]
```

If you wish, you can also build the image yourself.

```console
$ docker build -t quay.io/drycc-addons/minio-client:latest 'https://github.com/drycc-addons/drycc-docker-minio-client.git#main:2022/debian'
```

## Connecting to other containers

Using [Docker container networking](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/), a MinIO(R) Client can be used to access other running containers such as [MinIO(R) server](https://github.com/drycc-addons/drycc-docker-minio).

Containers attached to the same network can communicate with each other using the container name as the hostname.

### Using the Command Line

In this example, we will create a MinIO(R) Client container that will connect to a MinIO(R) server container that is running on the same docker network.

#### Step 1: Create a network

```console
$ docker network create app-tier --driver bridge
```

#### Step 2: Launch the MinIO(R) server container

Use the `--network app-tier` argument to the `docker run` command to attach the MinIO(R) container to the `app-tier` network.

```console
$ docker run -d --name minio-server \
    --env MINIO_ROOT_USER="minio-root-user" \
    --env MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD="minio-root-password" \
    --network app-tier \
    quay.io/drycc-addons/minio:latest
```

#### Step 3: Launch your MinIO(R) Client container

Finally we create a new container instance to launch the MinIO(R) client and connect to the server created in the previous step. In this example, we create a new bucket in the MinIO(R) storage server:

```console
$ docker run --rm --name minio-client \
    --env MINIO_SERVER_HOST="minio-server" \
    --env MINIO_SERVER_ACCESS_KEY="minio-root-user" \
    --env MINIO_SERVER_SECRET_KEY="minio-root-password" \
    --network app-tier \
    quay.io/drycc-addons/minio-client \
    mb minio/my-bucket
```

## Configuration

MinIO(R) Client (`mc`) can be setup so it is already configured to point to a specific MinIO(R) server by providing the environment variables below:

- `MINIO_SERVER_HOST`: MinIO(R) server host.
- `MINIO_SERVER_PORT_NUMBER`: MinIO(R) server port. Default: `9000`.
- `MINIO_SERVER_SCHEME`: MinIO(R) server scheme. Default: `http`.
- `MINIO_SERVER_ACCESS_KEY`: MinIO(R) server Access Key. Must be common on every node.
- `MINIO_SERVER_SECRET_KEY`: MinIO(R) server Secret Key. Must be common on every node.

For instance, use the command below to create a new bucket in the MinIO(R) Server `my.minio.domain`:

```console
$ docker run --rm --name minio-client \
    --env MINIO_SERVER_HOST="my.minio.domain" \
    --env MINIO_SERVER_ACCESS_KEY="minio-access-key" \
    --env MINIO_SERVER_SECRET_KEY="minio-secret-key" \
    bitnami/minio-client \
    mb minio/my-bucket
```
